R-package to perform patient matching using ICD-10 codes

This package contains functions that can be used to perform gold standard matching using ICD-10 codes. For this we rely on functionality from X and X packages. 
Additionaly, we provide an easy to use function to perform W2v Enhanced patient MATCHing (WEMATCH) as described by Nguyen et al. (2019).
